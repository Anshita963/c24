          "advance" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Per the BEA, the decline
           in first-quarter GDP was, in part, due to the response to the spread of COVID-19, as governments 
           issued "stay-at-home" orders in March. This led to rapid changes in demand as businesses and 
           schools switched to remote work or canceled operations and consumers canceled, restricted, or 
           redirected their spending.
