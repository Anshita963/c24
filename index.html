			<h1>What is Coronavirus ?</h1>
			<p>A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat.
				Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
				<br><br>
				In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified
				SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
				<br><br>
				COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract
				infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory
				tract (windpipe and lungs).
				<br><br>
				It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections
				range from mild to deadly.
				<br><br>
				SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like
				Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other
				coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but arenâ€™t a serious threat for
				otherwise healthy people.
				<br><br>
				Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,cough, headache, fatigue,
				breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen 
				days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop
				 noticeable symptoms.
				 <br><br> Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed 
				 as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% 
				 develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), 
				 and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).
				  Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to 
				  experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs
				   has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term 
				   effects of the disease.<br><br>

COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles.
 The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled 
 over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with 
 contaminated fluids, in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. People remain
  contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop any symptoms.<br><br>

Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease.
 The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription
  polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by 
  reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.

			<h1>What is Covid-19 ?</h1>
			<p>While coronaviruses are common, coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus that had previously
				not been identified in humans. The key features of COVID-19 are respiratory symptoms with a fever and
				cough. Like all new infections, understanding COVID-19 is important and changes rapidly. The CDC is
				proactively monitoring the virus and taking measures like providing guidance for health care workers and
				issuing travel recommendations.
				How are coronaviruses spread?
				An investigation of the COVID-19 is still ongoing but other human coronaviruses are spread through
				person-to-person contact. Similar to cold and flu, a person becomes sick through close contact with an
				infected person. The virus is spread through respiratory droplets produced by an infected person through
				coughing and sneezing or by touching surfaces with the virus on them.<br>
				There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A coronavirus identified in 2019,
				 SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19. 
				 COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that emerged in December 2019.
				 COVID-19 can be severe, and has caused millions of deaths around the world as well as lasting health problems in some who have survived the illness.
				 The coronavirus can be spread from person to person. It is diagnosed with a laboratory test.
				 COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and vaccination programs are in progress across the U.S. and in many parts of the world.
				 Prevention involves physical distancing, mask-wearing, hand hygiene and staying away from others if you feel sick.</p>

			<h1>Prevention</h1>
			<p>Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene,
				washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing
				into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the
				infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public. Physical distancing measures are also
				recommended to prevent transmission. Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected
				are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.</p>
			<p> Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they
				have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.
				Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest
				self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups. Those who may have been
				exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the
				widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible
				exposure</p>

				<h1>Social distancing</h1>
				<p>Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to
					slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include
					quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or
					shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting
					travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves
					from others. Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions
					affected by the outbreak. Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to
					the further spread of the pandemic.

					<br>
					The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was
					swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people,
					and later to 10. On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. A
					Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in
					limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local
					conditions vary.
					<br>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h1>Face masks and respiratory hygiene</h1>
				<p>The CDC and WHO recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there
					is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
					This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic
					individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing. Face
					coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking,
					breathing, and coughing. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face
					masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.
